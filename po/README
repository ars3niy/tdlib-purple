Do not edit these files!

The translations are maintained in Transifex:
    https://www.transifex.com/tdlib-purple-developers/tdlib-purple/

Contributors therefore should have no need to meddle with these files directly.

The main developers are supposed to fetch the translations from there,
unzip the result into this folder, and NOT TOUCH the files.
